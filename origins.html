<section class="origins">
<p>
Romania’s history stretches back over two millennia and is rich with influence from various cultures, empires, and kingdoms. The region that today forms Romania was originally inhabited by the Dacians, an ancient people who lived in what is now modern-day Romania and Moldova, as well as parts of Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. The Dacians were skilled warriors and craftsmen, known for their intricate metalwork, and their civilization flourished from about 500 BC until the early 2nd century AD.
</p>
<h3>Roman Conquest and Dacian Kingdoms (106 AD - 271 AD)</h3>
<p>
In 106 AD, the Roman Empire, under Emperor Trajan, conquered the Dacians after a series of wars known as the Dacian Wars. This victory led to the establishment of the Roman province of Dacia, a region that included parts of modern Romania. The Romanization of the area deeply influenced the region’s culture, economy, and language. The Latin language, brought by the Romans, eventually evolved into Romanian, making Romania one of the few Latin-speaking countries in Eastern Europe.
</p>
<h3>The Middle Ages (9th - 14th Century)</h3>
<p>
Following the withdrawal of the Romans around 271 AD due to increasing pressure from barbarian invasions, the region fell under the influence of several different tribes and empires, including the Huns, Goths, and Slavs. The Hungarian Kingdom played a significant role in shaping the region’s early medieval history, particularly in Transylvania.
</p>
<p>
During the 14th century, the principality of Wallachia (in the south) and the principality of Moldavia (in the east) were founded. These early kingdoms, often under the threat of invasions from the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, formed important cultural and political foundations for Romania. The Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, a notorious ruler from the 15th century, became one of the most famous figures in Romanian history for his brutal defense against the Ottoman Turks.
</p>
<h3>The Union of the Principalities (19th Century)</h3>
<p>
The two principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia, were united in 1859 under the leadership of Alexander John Cuza, forming the modern Romanian state. This union marked the beginning of Romania as a modern political entity. Romania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877, after the Russo-Turkish War, and was formally recognized as an independent kingdom in 1881 under King Carol I.
</p>
<h3>World War I and Greater Romania (1918)</h3>
<p>
Romania played a key role in World War I, siding with the Allied Powers. Following the war, Romania experienced a period of expansion and territorial growth. In 1918, after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Romania united with Transylvania, Bukovina, and Bessarabia to form Greater Romania, a large and influential country in Eastern Europe.
</p>
<h3>World War II and Communist Era (1940-1989)</h3>
<p>
During World War II, Romania initially aligned itself with the Axis Powers but later switched sides to the Allies in 1944. The post-war period saw Romania fall under Soviet influence, and in 1947, the Romanian monarchy was abolished by the communist regime. Nicolae Ceaușescu, who became president in 1967, established a totalitarian regime that severely restricted freedom and economic growth, while also pursuing policies that led to widespread poverty and hardship.
</p>
<h3>Revolution and Modern Romania (1989 - Present)</h3>
<p>
In 1989, Romania witnessed a violent revolution that overthrew Ceaușescu’s regime. The overthrow of the dictator marked the end of communism in Romania, leading to the establishment of a democratic republic. Since then, Romania has undergone significant political, economic, and social reforms.
In 2007, Romania became a member of the European Union and has since made significant strides in its economic development and modernization. Today, Romania continues to preserve its rich historical and cultural heritage while embracing a future of progress within the European and global community.
